# Dynamic programming
* In DP probelm breaks into sub problem and save the result for future.  
* It is mainly used to sovle optimization problems.  
* DP guarantees optimal soltion of a problem if the solution exists.  

### Key Words  
1) Memoization  
2) Tabulation  
3) Optimal Solution  
4) Overlaping subproblems


### Approaches of DP
1) Top - down approach (Memorization / memoization technique).  
2) Bottom -up approach (Tabulation technique).  



### All problems
-> all possible ways or count the no.of ways.  
-> min or max (best way).  


### shortcut
1) Try ro represent the problem in terms of index.  
2) Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.  
If Questions say  
-> all possible way = sum(all possible stuffs)  
-> find min = min(all possible stuffs)  
-> find amx = max(all possible stuffs)  


### Problems
1) Min Cost Climbing Stairs  
2) Maximum sum of non-adjacent elements  
3) Ninja Training  
4) Unique Paths  
5) Triangle  
6) 0/1 Knapsack
