# Stack & Queue

## Stack

Last in first out(LIFO)  

### Operations
1) push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
2) top/peek: Returns the top element of the stack.  
3) pop: Removes the top element of the stack.  
Note: some may use pop = pop + top which means pop removes and returns the top element of the stack.  

## Queue

First in first out (FIFO)  

### Operations
1) Enqueue: This operation adds an element to the back (rear) of the queue.  
2) Dequeue: This operation removes an element from the front (front) of the queue.  

### Other Operations on Queue and Stack

1) Peek: This operation returns the value of the front element without removing it from the queue.  
2) Size: This operation returns the number of elements currently in the queue.  
3) isEmpty: This operation returns true if the queue is empty, and false otherwise.  
4) isFull: This operation returns true if the queue is full (in case of a fixed-size queue), and false otherwise.
