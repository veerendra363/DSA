## Hashing  
Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.  

A hash function is a fixed procedure that changes a key into a hash key.
