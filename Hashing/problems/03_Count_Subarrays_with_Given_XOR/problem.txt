link: https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/count-subarrays-with-given-xor_1115652

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers ‘ARR’ and an integer ‘X’, 
you are supposed to find the number of sub arrays of 'ARR' which have bitwise XOR of the elements equal to 'X'.

Example:
Input: 
5 8
5 3 8 3 10
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
3 <= N <= 5 * 10 ^ 4
0 <= X <= 10 ^ 9
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 9
Where ‘T’ denotes the number of test cases, ‘N’ denotes the number of elements in the array, 
‘X’ denotes the required sub array XOR and ARR[i] denotes the 'i-th' element of the given array.
